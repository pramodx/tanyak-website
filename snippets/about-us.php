        Tanyak (Sanskrit word meaning resilient) is a social enterprise aiming to support development of
        resilient communities, infrastructure, technologies, businesses, cities and governance mechanisms.
        Started informally in 2019, it took a formal shape of a registered Not for profit organisation in early
        2020 during the North East Delhi Violence and amid Covid 19 lockdowns. Team TANYAKâ€™s initial
        programs supported violence affected communities; assisted migrant workers with food, health,
        essential relief, and supported authorities with arrangement of safe transport of migrant workers.
